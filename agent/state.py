"""Typed blackboard with named channels + reducers (the state-schema layer).

A `State` is a `dict` (so legacy nodes that do `state["k"] = v` still work — that is
a last-write), PLUS:
  - `merge(key, value)` — reducer-aware write, for channels more than one node writes.
  - `scope(*keys)`      — a read-only slice handed to a sub-agent (scoped INPUT).
  - `absorb(out, keys)` — merge a sub-agent's scoped OUTPUT back, channel by channel.

Reducers are the rule for combining concurrent writes to one channel. Without them,
two parallel writers silently clobber each other; with them you choose append / union /
sum / last. This contract is what makes safe parallelism and subgraphs possible.
